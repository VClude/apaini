# DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT

## Telephony API Packages (12.10)
```java
android.telephony.TelephonyManager
```

## SQLite Command to View All Tables
inside the SQLite Command Line type :
```java
.tables
```
## SQLiteQueryBuilder with it's Public Methods
SQLiteQueryBuilder to build query without knowing the query.
SQLiteQueryBuilder.setTables(string tables) to declare the tables, multiple can be mentioned.
to create table, use only raw sql (CREATE TABLE bleh bleh)

## Content Providers
Use Custom content providers to share data between different apps, as you can't do that without this.
the code is fucking long i dont want to write it, ty.

## Shared Preferences
Store a key value data into an xml files usually stored in
```
/data/data/YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME/shared_prefs/YOUR_PREFS_NAME.xml
```
the code to edit and create (if not exists) shared preferences is
```java
String myPrefs = "myPrefs";
SharedPreferences sp = getSharedPreferences(myPrefs, Activity.MODE_PRIVATE);
ShatedPreferences.editor edit = sp.edit();

edit.putInt("key", value);
edit.commit();
```
to retrieve is declare the above sharedpref object and then write :
```java
String dataFromSharedPrefs = sp.getInt("key",specifyDefaultValue);
```

## Testing Consideration
If you are not stupid enough to develop an ugly ass android apps, takes this into consideration:
1. **Change in Orientation**, users can flip the phone into whatever the fucks they want, so please ensure your apps :
    * The UI is redrawn quickly when user changes orientation
    * The apps maintain its state during orientation changes and does not lose user input that have been entered
2. **Change in the device's configuration**, check whether the apps can adapt, improvise, overcome the changes within the device configuration.
3. **Battery Life**, Make sure your apps only uses minimal amounts of battery and Runs smoothly inside **KAPTEN's** phones for at least 2000 Hours
4. **Dependence on external resources**, If your apps uses external resources such as internet connection, gps, etc. you should test your apps behavior and performance in the absence of these resources (e.g notifying the user that their internet is disconnected), so your apps can be used for poor fucks man.

## EULA
Eula is End User License Agreement, it must be added before you publish your apps in store.
Steps Before :
* Testing the app on actual devices 

After:
* Add Licensing Support

## Android Manifest (Read Code Comment)

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!-- Package name-->
<manifest
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:versionCode="1"
    android:versionName="1.0"
    package="com.example.myapp">
    <!--Permission-->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SEND_SMS"/>
    
    <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="15" android:targetSdkVersion="26" />
    
    <application
        android:allowBackup="true"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
        android:roundIcon="@mipmap/ic_launcher_round"
        android:label="@string/app_name"
        android:supportsRtl="true"
        android:theme="@style/AppTheme">

        <!-- Activity -->
        <activity android:name=".MainActivity">
            <intent-filter>
                <!--Intent Filter-->
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>

        <activity
            android:name=".DisplayMessageActivity"
            android:parentActivityName=".MainActivity" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```
Codes inside Application Tag :
* `<activity>` for each subclass of Activity.
* `<service>` for each subclass of Service.
* `<receiver>` for each subclass of BroadcastReceiver.
* `<provider>` for each subclass of ContentProvider.

## Activity Lifecycle
* **onCreate**	called when activity is first created.
* **onStart**	called when activity is becoming visible to the user.
* **onResume**	called when activity will start interacting with the user.
* **onPause**	called when activity is not visible to the user.
* **onStop**	called when activity is no longer visible to the user.
* **onRestart**	called after your activity is stopped, prior to start.
* **onDestroy**	called before the activity is destroyed.

## Intent
* **Implicit Intents** start a component from another apps or from system (like dialing a call, opening xnxx.com in the browser, etc.)
* **Explicit Intents** start a component from our apps, typically starting another activity.

Intent Example :

**Implicit**
```java
Intent intent=new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);  
intent.setData(Uri.parse("https://www.hentaimama.com"));  
startActivity(intent); 
```
**Explicit**
```java
Intent i = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), ActivityTwo.class);  
startActivity(i);  
```

## Activity Phase
See Activity Lifecycle, pretty much the fucking same.

## DDMS Perspective

DDMS stands for Dalvik Debug Monitor Server. It gives the wide array of debugging features:

1. Port forwarding services
2. Screen capture
3. Thread and heap information
4. Network traffic tracking
5. Location data spoofing

## Static Files As resources using `Android.content.res.Resources`
Used when you want to include large or pre existing files as a resouce for your app instead of a database.

usage :
```java
Resources myRes = getResources();
InputStream files = myRes.openRawResource(R.raw.myfilename);
```

## ADB
Android Debug Bridge, allow to interacts with device/emulator using command line

Command : `adb [-d|-e|-s <phone serial>] <command>`

example : `adb devices`, `adb start-server`, `adb kill-server`

## Progress Dialog
We can display the android progress bar dialog box to display the status of work being done e.g. downloading porn, analyzing status of work etc.

usage:
```java
ProgressDialog progressBar = new ProgressDialog(this);  
progressBar.setCancelable(true);//you can cancel it by pressing back button  
progressBar.setMessage("Porn downloading ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)....");  
progressBar.setProgressStyle(ProgressDialog.STYLE_HORIZONTAL);  
progressBar.setProgress(0);//initially progress is 0  
progressBar.setMax(100);//sets the maximum value 100  
progressBar.show();//displays the progress bar  
```
## SMS and Call with Intent &trade;

**Snip** Read it yourself at Page 12.3

## Android Building Block
Too General, Read page 2.15

## Ordered Broadcasts
Ordered Broadcast is the type of broadcast which is sent in a synchronous manner i.e. one by one to each listener. (Broadcast Definition see Page 8.15)

example:
```java
private static String Log_Tag = "SendOrderedBroadcastActivity";
private static String Action = "com.example.mypackage";
private static String Extras = "Breadcrumb";

Intent intent = new Intent(Action);
        sendOrderedBroadcast(intent, null, new BroadcastReceiver() {
            @SuppressLint("NewApi")
            @Override
            public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
                Bundle results = getResultExtras(true);
                Log.i(Log_Tag, "Final Result Receiver = " + results.getString(Extras, "nil"));
            }
        }, null, Activity.RESULT_OK, null, null);
```

## Bitmap, Paint, Canvas, View
* Canvas (Package `android.graphics.Canvas`) represents a surface where you can draw shapes and images

* Bitmap (Package `android.graphics.Bitmap`) When you create `Canvas` object it is necessary to create atleast one `Bitmap ` Object, which holds the pixel data for the graphics.

* Paint (Package `android.graphics.Paint`) provides information about the style & colors for drawing a symbols, text, and graphics
* view (Package `android.view.View`) simple graphics and animation that does not requires high framerate. Must extend this class to draw crap ex: `class Panel extends View`

## Layout Inflater
Get an Element from Another Layout XML.

When you use a custom view in a `ListView` you must define the row layout. You create an xml where you place android widgets and then in the adapter's code you have to do something like this:
```java
public MyAdapter(Context context, List<MyObject> objects) extends ArrayAdapter {
  super(context, 1, objects);
  /* We get the inflator in the constructor */
  mInf = (LayoutInflater) context.getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);
}

@Override
public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
  View view;
  /* We inflate the xml which gives us a view */
  view = mInflater.inflate(R.layout.my_list_custom_row, parent, false);

  /* Get the item in the adapter */
  MyObject myObject = getItem(position);

  /* Get the widget with id name which is defined in the xml of the row */
  TextView name = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.name);

  /* Populate the row's xml with info from the item */
  name.setText(myObject.getName());

  /* Return the generated view */
  return view;
}
```
## `LocationManager.NETWORK_PROVIDERS`

Represents the name of the network location provider, point the location of cell towers and/or wi-fi. Results are retrieved by means of network lookup. The providers Requires the `android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` or `android.permission.ACCESS_FINE.LOCATION`.

Other Options are `LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDERS`, it uses GPS for providing location data.

## TOAST
to notify user, takes only small amount of screen, and will fade eventually (Package `android.widget.Toast`)

example:
```java
Toast toast = Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(),
        "This is a message displayed in a Toast",
        Toast.LENGTH_SHORT);
    
toast.show();
```
## Making an instance of TelephonyManager
```java
public abstract Object getSystemService(String name)
```
## Content Provider in AndroidManifest.XML
Wrap it inside `<application>` tag
```xml
<provider
   android:name=".provider.LentItemsProvider"
   android:authorities="de.openminds.samples.cpsample.lentitems"
   android:exported="true"
   android:grantUriPermissions="true"
   android:label="LentItemsProvider"
   android:readPermission="de.openminds.samples.cpsample.lentitems.READ"
   android:writePermission="de.openminds.samples.cpsample.lentitems.WRITE" />
```

## Custom Provider
After creating the custom provider, register it in AndroidManifest.xml.
```xml
<provider
   android:name="myCustomProvider"
   android:authorities="com.DatabaseDemo.provider.myCustomProvider">
</provider>
```

## View Listener
* `onClick()`
From `View.OnClickListener`. This is called when the user either touches the item (when in touch mode), or focuses upon the item with the navigation-keys or trackball and presses the suitable "enter" key or presses down on the trackball.
* `onLongClick()`
From `View.OnLongClickListener`. This is called when the user either touches and holds the item (when in touch mode), or focuses upon the item with the navigation-keys or trackball and presses and holds the suitable "enter" key or presses and holds down on the trackball (for one second).
* `onFocusChange()`
From `View.OnFocusChangeListener`. This is called when the user navigates onto or away from the item, using the navigation-keys or trackball.
* `onKey()`
From `View.OnKeyListener`. This is called when the user is focused on the item and presses or releases a hardware key on the device.
* `onTouch()`
From `View.OnTouchListener`. This is called when the user performs an action qualified as a touch event, including a press, a release, or any movement gesture on the screen (within the bounds of the item).
* `onCreateContextMenu()`
From `View.OnCreateContextMenuListener`. This is called when a Context Menu is being built (as the result of a sustained "long click"). 

## EXIT SHELL LINUX
exit/stop command use `ctrl+d`
exit shell use command `exit`

or find the pid and then kill it `ps -ax | grep shell_name`  and `pkill -9 PID_of_shell`
